# Purpose:

This is simply the yaml code that I recently used for one of my courses. Here I will go through each section and explain what they do.

```yaml

```

## Triggers:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - develop
      - main
```

The pipeline will run everytime you merge anything into the chosen trigger branches which will build the program and run the tests.
